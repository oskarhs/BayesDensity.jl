# Plotting

Graphical displays are a powerful tool for providing informative vizual summaries of the result of a given Bayesian inference procedure for a univariate density. `BayesDensity` makes it easy to plot posterior summaries for ``f`` using the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or variational inference through its extensions for the [Makie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) and [Plots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) packages.

In addition to documenting the plotting-related public API, this page also showcases the plotting capabilities of the `BayesDensityCore` package through examples. Although we will not delve deep into implementational details here, some familiarity with `Makie.jl` or `Plots.jl` is an advantage when reading this part of the documentation.

The following sections are structured so that the `Makie`- and the `Plots`-portions of the tutorial can be read independently of one another. As such, there is no need for a `Makie` power-user to read the `Plots` sections of this page.
