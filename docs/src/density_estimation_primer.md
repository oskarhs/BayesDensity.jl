# A primer on Bayesian nonparametric density estimation

The following page provides a short introduction to nonparametric density estimation, with a particular focus on Bayesian approaches.
The topic of nonparametric density estimation is vast, and we do as such only aim to provide a rather broad overview here.
For an in-depth and quite accessible introduction to frequentist approaches in nonparametric density estimation, we recommend [Scott1992multivariate](@citet).
A good introduction to the Bayesian perspective, with a focus on practical computation, can be found in [Gelman2013bayesian](@citet).

% TODO: Explain basics behind smoothing parameters. Also a very brief intro to MCMC. ALso show how MCMC output elvolves with increasing iterations through an animation.
